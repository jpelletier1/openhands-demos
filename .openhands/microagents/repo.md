# Architecture Guidelines
- Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, only develop in Javascript, HTML, and CSS when possible. If you must create backend code, do it using NodeJS.
- This is not production code. This is prototype code to illustrate how to use OpenHands.

# Documentation Guidelines
- The repo contains directories for different use cases. If your task is to create a new use case, make sure to add the use case to the README.md in the root of this repo.
- Do not use emojis when writing documentation or making README updates.
- Focus on being concise when possible.
