# Architecture Guidelines
- Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, only develop in Javascript, HTML, and CSS when possible. If you must create backend code, do it using NodeJS.
- This is not production code. This is prototype code to illustrate how to use OpenHands.
- The repo contains directories for different use cases. If your task is to create a new use case, make sure to update the README.md in the root of the repo with that new use case.
